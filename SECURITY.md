## Security Policy

### Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report any security vulnerabilities to the project maintainers privately. Do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

You can report security vulnerabilities by:
1. Opening a private security advisory on GitHub
2. Contacting the maintainers directly

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report and send you regular updates about our progress. If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work on a fix and release it as soon as possible.
